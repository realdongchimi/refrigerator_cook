# Project: refrigerator_cook

## Project Overview

This is a SwiftUI application for iOS named "refrigerator_cook". Based on the project name, it is likely intended to be an application that helps users cook with ingredients they have in their refrigerator.

The project is in its very early stages. It currently consists of a minimal SwiftUI app structure with a single view displaying "Hello, world!".

**Key Technologies:**
*   **Language:** Swift
*   **UI Framework:** SwiftUI
*   **Platform:** iOS

## Building and Running

1.  **Open the project:** Open the `refrigerator_cook.xcodeproj` file in Xcode.
    ```bash
    open refrigerator_cook.xcodeproj
    ```
2.  **Select a simulator or device:** Choose an iOS simulator (e.g., "iPhone 15 Pro") or a connected physical device from the scheme menu in the Xcode toolbar.
3.  **Run the app:** Click the "Run" button (the play icon) or press `Cmd+R`.

## Development Conventions

*   **Architecture:** The project currently follows the standard SwiftUI app structure. As it develops, it would be beneficial to adopt a clear architectural pattern like MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) to separate concerns.
*   **UI:** The UI is built using SwiftUI.
*   **Dependencies:** There are no external dependencies declared yet. If needed, Swift Package Manager (SPM) is the standard way to manage them.
